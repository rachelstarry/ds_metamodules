# Digital Scholarship Meta-Modules: Professional Development for Librarians


The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) has published a series of self-guided modules to introduce “digital novices” to the basics of the diverse areas of digital scholarship. These modules are primarily aimed at an audience of faculty and students (primarily graduate students), and some – though not all – of the topics have a social-science emphasis.

While these modules are in general a fantastic resource for those new to digital scholarship, they were not created for an academic library audience. Librarians who wish to gain a basic familiarity with the breadth of topics, methodologies, tools, and vocabulary associated with digital scholarship will likely find these modules useful on the whole, but their learning objectives, readings, and questions to consider are primarily aimed at faculty and students who want to become digital scholarship practitioners or integrate digital tools and methods in their research or teaching. 

In order to transform the SSRC’s Doing Digital Scholarship modules into a more useful training opportunity for librarians, we have created a series of “meta modules” which are based on the SSRC’s modules, with the goal of more closely aligning these short, self-guided lessons with the purpose of librarian professional development. The “meta modules” provide additional background, guidance, and questions to consider that are specific to an audience of library faculty and staff who wish to develop their awareness of digital scholarship tools, methods, and vocabulary in order to expand their knowledge, skillsets, and ability to better support researchers in engaging with digital scholarship.
