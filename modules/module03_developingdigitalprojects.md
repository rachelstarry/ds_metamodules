## Introduction

...

## Activities

- [ ] Skim the SSRC article on [Project Planning](https://labs.ssrc.org/dds/articles/project-planning/) <br>
	Instead of (or in addition to) thinking through these planning steps for a digital project *you* are developing, consider *what resources or knowledge you would need* in order to advise a researcher through the project planning process: 
	* Familiarity with particular tools or methods? 
	* Knowledge of digital scholarship funding sources and the grant proposal process/timeline?
	* Understanding of user design or communication strategies for different audiences?
	* Knowledge of institutional infrastructure and local sources of expertise or funding?

- [ ] Explore [PM4DH: Project Management for the Digital Humanities](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/pm4dh/)
	* Read the materials created by the [Emory Center for Digital Scholarship](http://ecds.emory.edu/) on the 5 stages in the digital project lifecycle: 1. Proposal	2. Initiation	3. Planning		4. Execution	5. Closing

- [ ] Additional Readings

- [ ] "Meta" Questions to Consider
	* In response to the article by Burress and Rowell, what project management strategies do you currently utilize? What strategies or approaches does your team, unit, or library currently employ? 
	* How might you or your library's strategies for supporting research project planning and development need to adapt in order to support digital scholarship projects, as described in the articles by Morgan and Tabak?
	* Across all of the various project planning and management phases described in the readings and activities, which aspects of digital project development are you currently prepared to support? Can you identify colleagues or potential partners, either within or beyond the library, who might be available to support other aspects of digital projects?

- [ ] Short Reflection
	* Take a few minutes and try to articulate what you will take away from the readings, activities, and resources covered in this module. What is one concept that you feel you now understand better? One topic that was completely new to you? One question you would like to explore further?
