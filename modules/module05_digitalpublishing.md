# Meta-Module #5: Digital Publishing & Digital Storytelling

This "meta-module" introduces a range of digital publishing platforms and approaches, including multimodal content management systems (CMS), static site creation, minimal computing, and innovative publishing platforms created by university presses.

**Estimated Completion Time = 4 hours**

## Outcomes

* Increased familiarity with a variety of multimodal publishing platforms created by university presses and other organizations
* Improved understanding of the affordances and limitations of multiple digital storytelling resources and platforms

- [ ] Explore and evaluate some multimodal university press platforms <br>
	Take a few minutes to read the "About" pages for these three platforms and explore 1-2 publications hosted on each of them.
	1. [Manifold Scholarship](https://manifoldapp.org/) (University of Minnesota Press and CUNY Graduate Center)
	2. [RavenSpace](https://ravenspacepublishing.org/) (University of British Columbia Press and University of Washington Press)
	3. [Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrum.org/) (University of Michigan Library and Press, with partners at Indiana, Minnesota, Northwestern, and Penn State) <br>

	As you read about each of these platforms, consider the following questions:
	* Who has access to materials published through this platform (who are its audiences)?
	* Who has the ability to publish through this platform (who are its authors)?
	* How does this platform allow authors to integrate multimedia, datasets, or other non-textual components?

- [ ] "Meta" Questions to Consider
	* Thinking about the various publishing platforms you have encountered during this module, what are some of the affordances of each for different modes of storytelling or scholarly communication? Are some better for short-form versus long-form text? How do they allow authors to incorporate multimedia, datasets, or other interactive, multimodal components into their narratives?
	* Given the development of so many open-source content management systems and publishing platforms, what role do you think academic libraries might play in helping scholars navigate this changing publishing landscape? 
	* How have your explorations of these platforms informed your understanding of the challenges and opportunities related to creating a digital storytelling project or publishing a digital monograph?
	* What are some of the benefits of minimal computing in comparison to university press platforms and self-hosted CMS sites?

- [ ] Short Reflection
	* Take a few minutes and try to articulate what you will take away from the readings, activities, and resources covered in this module. What is one concept that you feel you now understand better? One topic that was completely new to you? One question you would like to explore further?
