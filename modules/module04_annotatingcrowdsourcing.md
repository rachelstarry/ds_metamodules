# Meta-Module #4: Annotating and Crowdsourcing Digital Projects

This "meta-module" offers an overview of digital tools and resources for annotation and crowdsourcing, as well as issues related to collaborative writing and transcription in the context of digital scholarship projects.

**Estimated Completion Time = 3 hours**

## Outcomes

* Increased understanding of the pedagogical applications for annotation and close reading
* Improved knowledge of issues related to digital project crowdsourcing
* Increased familiarity with tools and platforms for collaborative writing, annotation, and transcription

## Activities

- [ ] Complete [SSRC Module 4: Annotating Digital Collections](https://labs.ssrc.org/dds/articles/4-annotating-digital-collections/)
	While [ThingLink](https://www.thinglink.com/edu) offers a free trial version for educators, the free and open-source web publishing platform [Scalar](https://scalar.me/anvc/) has built-in image annotation functionality. [Read about Scalar's annotation capabilities here.](https://scalar.me/anvc/features/annotations/)

- [ ] Review the [SSRC Resource Sheet: Crowdsourcing Tools](https://labs.ssrc.org/dds/articles/resource-sheet-crowdsourcing-tools/)
	For each the three tools introduced - [Crowdcrafting](https://scifabric.com/crowdcrafting/), [Scripto](http://scripto.org/), and [Scribe](http://scribeproject.github.io/) - explore at least one example project built using the tool and consider the following questions:
	* Is this platform still functional? If not, can you tell what happened to projects built with the tool? ([^Click here](#noteA) to read more about Crowdcrafting and an alternative, [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/).)
	* What web publishing platforms and media formats is this tool compatible with? 
	* Does the tool have particular infrastructure requirements?
	* What is the transcription workflow?
	* What kinds of projects have utilized this tool? What are the affordances of this tool for particular types of research questions or disciplines (i.e. might it have different utility for the humanities, STEM fields, or social sciences)?

- [ ] Explore and evaluate [*Transcribe Bentham*](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/)
	As you have done for the "Project Lens" activities in some of the SSRC modules, take a few minutes to browse through the Transcribe Bentham blog and transcription interface, considering the following questions:
	* What is the purpose of this project? What are the goals? Who created this project and who is it for? How do you find out?

- [ ] "Meta" Questions to Consider
	* Do you see any potential technical or ethical issues that might impact the use of annotation tools in the classroom, related to student privacy or platform interoperability? How might you advise instructors on the use of annotation tools with these potential issues in mind? 
	* Are some annotation or transcription tools more transparent than others about data use and privacy?
	* Based on your exploration of digital projects with text or handwriting transcription components as well as the theoretical framework for audio transcription discussed in the Bailey article, do text and audio transcription projects face similar challenges? Are there issues unique to different kinds of transcription? What challenges might a scholar face in developing an audio-transcription crowdsourcing project?

- [ ] Short Reflection
	* Take a few minutes and try to articulate what you will take away from the readings, activities, and resources covered in this module. What is one concept that you feel you now understand better? One topic that was completely new to you? One question you would like to explore further?

<a name="noteA">^</a> As of April 1, 2019, Scifabric discontinued support for Crowdcrafting and appears to have discontinued hosting services as well, meaning legacy projects are no longer available to view online. An archived version of the example project discussed in the SSRC Resource Sheet, [*Crime, Sex, and Violence*](https://web.archive.org/web/20170926104507/http://crowdcrafting.org/project/crime%2Csex%2Candviolence/), is available via the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), although the transcription interface supported by Crowdcrafting is no longer available. Explore the capabilities and projects on [Zooniverse.org](https://www.zooniverse.org/) as an alternative platform.
