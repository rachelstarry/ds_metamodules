## Activities

- [ ] Complete [SSRC Module 4: Annotating Digital Collections](https://labs.ssrc.org/dds/articles/4-annotating-digital-collections/)

- [ ] Additional Readings
	* 

- [ ] Review the [SSRC Resource Sheet: Crowdsourcing Tools](https://labs.ssrc.org/dds/articles/resource-sheet-crowdsourcing-tools/)
	For each the three tools introduced - [Crowdcrafting](https://scifabric.com/crowdcrafting/), [Scripto](http://scripto.org/), and [Scribe](http://scribeproject.github.io/) - explore at least one example project built using the tool and consider the following questions:
	* Is this platform still functional? If not, can you tell what happened to projects built with the tool? ([Click here](#noteA) to read more about Crowdcrafting and an alternative, [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/).)
	* What web publishing platforms and media formats is this tool compatible with? 
	* Does the tool have particular infrastructure requirements?
	* What is the transcription workflow?
	* What kinds of projects have utilized this tool? What are the affordances of this tool for particular types of research questions or disciplines (i.e. might it have different utility for the humanities, STEM fields, or social sciences)?

- [ ] "Meta" Questions to Consider
	* ...

- [ ] Short Reflection
	* Take a few minutes and try to articulate what you will take away from the readings, activities, and resources covered in this module. What is one concept that you feel you now understand better? One topic that was completely new to you? One question you would like to explore further?

<a name="noteA">^</a> As of April 1, 2019, Scifabric discontinued support for Crowdcrafting and appears to have discontinued hosting services as well, meaning legacy projects are no longer available to view online. An archived version of the example project discussed in the SSRC Resource Sheet, [*Crime, Sex, and Violence*](https://web.archive.org/web/20170926104507/http://crowdcrafting.org/project/crime%2Csex%2Candviolence/), is available via the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), although the transcription interface supported by Crowdcrafting is no longer available. Explore the capabilities and projects on [Zooniverse.org](https://www.zooniverse.org/) as an alternative platform.
