# Meta-Module #2: Working with Digital Collections

This "meta-module" introduces some tools and resources for finding and creating digital collections, as well as methods for utilizing collections for digitally-inflected research and teaching.

**Estimated Completion Time = 4 hours**

## Outcomes

* Increased understanding of the affordances of print versus digital media for research and teaching
* Improved familiarity with online repositories and platforms for preserving and publishing digital materials (either born-digital or digitized)
* Improved ability to select a content management system for different kinds of digital collections

- [ ] Alternate "Questions to Consider" for SSRC Module 5 and Additional Readings:
	* ...

- [ ] Review the [SSRC's list of Digital Collections](https://labs.ssrc.org/dds/articles/digital-collections/)
	* Select and explore 2 or 3 collections that are unfamiliar to you
	* Consider the following questions for the collections you selected:
		* Who created this collection - was it an individual, a project team, an academic institution, a non-profit organization, a commercial publisher, etc.? How might the authorship of a collection impact how it is organized, how it should be understood, or how it can be used?
		* Can you determine the criteria for the inclusion of materials in this collection?
		* Who is responsible for maintaining this collection? Is it static or continuously developing? 
		* What kind of funding model supports the collection - short-term grant funding, ongoing institutional support, or some combination? How might this affect the availability of the materials in this collection, if a researcher relies on the materials for their research or teaching?

- [ ] Explore the resources on [Always Already Computational - Collections As Data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/)
	* Read the [Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/)
	* Select and explore 2 or 3 [Collections as Data "Facets"](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/facets/). These are examples of ways that libraries, museums, and archives are developing practices, infrastructure, and services to encourage the computational use of digital collections.
	* Consider the following questions for the facets you selected:
		* What issues or practical concerns was this implementation of Collections as Data responding to within its institutional context? Does it attempt to address the needs of a particular community or physical collection?
		* How is your library supporting or promoting the use of digital collections for research and teaching? What would your library require to implement Collections as Data practices, and are there communities at your institution that might benefit from such services?

- [ ] Short Reflection
	* Take a few minutes and try to articulate what you will take away from the readings, activities, and resources covered in this module. What is one concept that you feel you now understand better? One topic that was completely new to you? One question you would like to explore further?
